Assess the cat\u2019s condition. Is it in immediate danger? If it\u2019s injured, sick, starving, dehydrated, or otherwise unlikely to survive outside, catch the cat. Do whatever you can do to get it off the street immediately. If you have to put it in your basement, garage, porch, whatever, it\u2019s better than where it was, and you can improve its situation drastically. Take the weather into account. Frail cats will be at a higher risk in very cold or very hot temperatures. If the cat is friendly, your work will be easier. If the cat is feral, you\u2019ll need to trap it. Check all cats for an ear tip - this will tell you if they\u2019ve already been TNR\u2019d. If the cat appears pregnant, make a clinic appointment immediately. Pregnant cats need to be spayed. Also, pyometra is a uterine infection which can kill cats if left untreated and can make cats look pregnant. If the cat looks at all possibly pregnant, prioritize their spay.

We focus our efforts on animals facing euthanasia at other shelters, as well as those who were victims of cruelty or neglect. We know the only way to fix pet overpopulation is to \"fix\" our pets. We are dedicated to ensuring that all pet owners, regardless of income, have access to affordable spay/neuter services. So in 2009, Animal Alliance founded the Planned Pethood low-cost spay/neuter clinic. Planned Pethood also offers affordable, basic veterinary care with the aim of keeping at-risk pets in their homes and out of shelters.

Humanely reducing free-roaming cat populations Even wildlife conservationists agree: Study proves TNR is the way to go When feral cats are trapped, neutered and returned to their territory, they no longer reproduce. Stopping sexual activity eliminates the noise associated with mating behavior and dramatically reduces fighting and the noise it causes. Neutered feral cats also roam much less and become less visible and less prone to injury from cars. Foul odors are greatly reduced as well because neutered male cats no longer spray or produce pungent urine. When the colony is then monitored by a caretaker who removes and/or TNRs any newly arrived cats, the population stabilizes and gradually declines over time. Female cats are healthier because they are no longer mating and giving birth. About Feral Cats Do Feral Cats Live Miserable Lives? According to a study conducted by Dr. Julie Levy at the University of Central Florida, the majority of cats (83 percent) in the 11 cat colonies studied were present on the campus for more than six years. It\u2019s quite likely that many of the observed cats far exceeded that life span, since approximately one-half of the free-roaming cats first observed in the study were already adults, so their true ages were unknown. Furthermore, according to Dr. Levy, the body weights of these free-roaming cats, when compared with pet cats in previous studies, exhibited \u201cno significant differences.\u201d Neutering these cats resulted in an increase in body weight and healthy overall body condition. Other studies reported similar findings. For instance, from 1993 to 2004, seven TNR organizations throughout the nation collected data on 103,643 free-roaming cats examined in spay/neuter clinics. Less than 1 percent of these animals needed to be euthanized because of debilitating conditions, trauma or infectious diseases. The one program that tested for FeLV and FIV reported an overall infection rate of 5.2 percent, which is similar to previous studies that reported results for both pet and feral cats. source Borrow Traps Trap Loan From Catadelphia Trap Loan from ACCT How to Trap The 7 Steps of TNR TNR Handbook from Neighborhood Cats Withhold food for a couple of days - just a couple, nothing extreme.

The sprinkler, which \u201cfires\u201d 1,000 times on only one 9-volt battery, covers an area approximately 45 feet wide by 35 feet long. Search online or call Contech, the manufacturer, for the nearest retailer: 1-800-767-8658. CatStop: This deterrent uses a motion sensor and emits a high-pitched, ultrasonic alarm that can\u2019t be heard by humans but will frighten most cats. You place the unit facing the area you want to protect and it covers about 300 sq.feet. It requires a 9-volt battery, and can operate up to nine months with one battery. CatStop is a good choice for areas where children play. Search online or call Contech, for the nearest retailer: 1-800-767-8658. Cat Scat: This non-chemical cat and wildlife repellent consists of plastic mats that are pressed into the soil. Each mat has flexible plastic spikes that are harmless but effective. You can purchase this product at www.gardeners.com . Shake-Away: This nontoxic granular deterrent contains the scent of fox, bobcat and coyote, animals that prey on cats. A 20-ounce bottle will cover 600 linear feet. One drawback is that it must be re-applied to remain effective. For more information, visit www.critter-repellent.com . Concrete pavers, river rocks, large pinecones, chicken wire (sharp edges down) or large bark can cover loose soil, discouraging cats from eliminating there. Plant the herb rue or coleus canina (scaredy-cat coleus), decorative plants that repel cats. Generously sprinkle cayenne pepper, coffee grounds, pipe tobacco, lemongrass oil, citronella oil, eucalyptus oil, or mustard oil on the ground to deter cats. To reduce the incidence of cats eliminating on neighbors\u2019 properties, caregivers need to either contain the cats or provide them with an appropriate place to do their business. Sometimes cat fencing can be used to keep the cats confined to a caregiver\u2019s property, but isn\u2019t always possible. In this case, caregivers should provide the cats with litter boxes and scoop them regularly. To make a large litter-box area, use plastic concrete mixers or a child\u2019s sandbox. One useful product for odor control is NaturVet Yard Odor Eliminator, available online at www.naturvet.com or by calling 1-888-628-8783.

Assume that any cat brought inside has tapeworms, as they\u2019re contracted by flea eggs, and will need to be treated. Other symptoms of worms include: Vomiting Unexplained weight loss (especially if hunger level is unchanged) Bloated or especially rounded belly Constipation Constant coughing Difficulty breathing Best course of action is a broad-spectrum dewormer like Drontal. This can be obtained over the counter or online, or at your vet. Deworming needs to be done more than once, at spaced out intervals, to kill both adult worms, and then any worms that emerge from eggs in a few weeks. Preventative deworming, as long as the cat/kitten is at an appropriate age and not suffering from any adverse conditions, will not harm the cat. When treated, all of the following worms can be cleared up easily. Some of these worms can be transmitted to humans, so handle your cat and their stool with care if you suspect worms. Tapeworms Tapeworms can be detected easily by looking at stool - if you see what appears to be grains of rice in the stool, that\u2019s indicative of tapeworms. They can also be long and flat, but because they are segmented, they are usually seen broken apart. Roundworms These are visible in the stool and look like spaghetti. Hookworms Not as common in cats as in dogs. These are less than an inch long, also thin like spaghetti. Whipworms Not as common in cats, not usually seen in the stool, but they look like tiny pieces of thread. Skin Issues Ringworm Mange Flea Bite Dermatitis Diarrhea While the underlying cause must be treated, diarrhea itself can quickly dehydrate a cat or kitten and should be stopped. Mixing PLAIN canned pumpkin into their food is a great way to firm up stool. Cats who come in off the street may have diarrhea due to poor nutrition. While the instinct may be to feed them as much as they will eat, this may make the diarrhea worse. Probiotics will help as well. You can find probiotics for pets at many pet stores and feed stores. They are cheaper in bulk, so shop around. For example, one oz of Fortiflora for cats is $32 at Petsmart. 8oz of probiotic powder appropriate for all species is $11 at Tractor Supply Co! Parvo Calici Upper Respiratory Infection (URI) Hairballs First, make sure your cat isn\u2019t under- or over-grooming. If they are, have a vet check them out. Try brushing your cat to help remove excess fur. A brush that helps remove undercoat like a Furminator may help. Over-the-counter hairball treatment may help ease the hairballs - do not use this if your cat is having issues with their stool, it will make it worse. A teaspoon or so of olive oil in your cat\u2019s food can help ease hairballs over time. Vomiting Thyroid FIV FeLV Feline Panleukopenia Lungworm Underweight Dental Issues How to Keep Your Cat\u2019s Mouth Healthy Aging Caring for Senior and Geriatric Cats Behavioral Issues Going outside box There can be a variety of reason why a cat won\u2019t use their litterbox. First, rule out medical issues such as UTI with your vet. Make sure you have enough litter boxes for how many cats you have. Make sure your box is big enough - some cats do not like a small box, or a covered box. Make sure you are cleaning your boxes daily. If you are using a scented litter, try an unscented litter. Try a litter with an attractant like Dr Elsey\u2019s Cat Attract. Litter Box Aversion Not getting along If this was a recent introduction, separate the cats and start over slowly. If the cats were previously getting along, take them to the vet to rule out a medical cause like pain or illness. Make sure each cat has their own space to be alone - their own bed, enough space to feel like they\u2019re not on top of one another. Anxiety CBD There is a lot out there on CBD.

Assume that any cat brought inside has tapeworms, as they\u2019re contracted by flea eggs, and will need to be treated. Other symptoms of worms include: * Vomiting * Unexplained weight loss (especially if hunger level is unchanged) * Bloated or especially rounded belly * Constipation * Constant coughing * Difficulty breathing Best course of action is a broad-spectrum dewormer like Drontal. This can be obtained over the counter or online, or at your vet. Deworming needs to be done more than once, at spaced out intervals, to kill both adult worms, and then any worms that emerge from eggs in a few weeks. Preventative deworming, as long as the cat/kitten is at an appropriate age and not suffering from any adverse conditions, will not harm the cat. When treated, all of the following worms can be cleared up easily. Some of these worms can be transmitted to humans, so handle your cat and their stool with care if you suspect worms. Tapeworms Tapeworms can be detected easily by looking at stool - if you see what appears to be grains of rice in the stool, that\u2019s indicative of tapeworms. They can also be long and flat, but because they are segmented, they are usually seen broken apart. Roundworms These are visible in the stool and look like spaghetti. Hookworms Not as common in cats as in dogs. These are less than an inch long, also thin like spaghetti. Whipworms Not as common in cats, not usually seen in the stool, but they look like tiny pieces of thread. Skin Issues Ringworm Mange Flea Bite Dermatitis Diarrhea While the underlying cause must be treated, diarrhea itself can quickly dehydrate a cat or kitten and should be stopped. Mixing PLAIN canned pumpkin into their food is a great way to firm up stool. Cats who come in off the street may have diarrhea due to poor nutrition. While the instinct may be to feed them as much as they will eat, this may make the diarrhea worse. Probiotics will help as well. You can find probiotics for pets at many pet stores and feed stores.

Make sure your box is big enough - some cats do not like a small box, or a covered box. Make sure you are cleaning your boxes daily. If you are using a scented litter, try an unscented litter.
