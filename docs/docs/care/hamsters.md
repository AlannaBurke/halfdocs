# Care and Keeping of Hamsters

## What type of food should I feed my hamster?

Hamsters, especially the dwarf breeds, are susceptible to
diabetes. Most foods that are sold by chain stores have
sugars, such as molasses, to hold the pellets together.
Seeds and corn also have sugars in them. If you give a
hamster the choice between junk foods (seeds, colored
chunks, corn or molasses) and a high quality, high fiber
food, they will overdo the junk food. Proper diet with high
quality ingredients and high fiber provides the best
nutrition and saves you money over time because a high
quality food that supports their bodies prevents hamsters
from overeating.

## What food brands should I buy for my hamster?

Oxbow Essentials and Harland Teklad Lab Pellets provide
the best nutritional balance for hamsters. Oxbow
Essentials is the most commercially available. To find a
retailer near you, visit www.oxbowanimalhealth.com.
Harland Teklad Lab Pellets are only available online at
www.thecraftyrat.com. Supreme Hazel Hamster Food is
also a pretty good mix, but be sure to pick out the corn if
you have a dwarf breed. For variety, you can add brown
rice, rolled oats and barley into whichever brand you
choose. Do not feed your hamster Hartz, Nutriphase,
Kaytee or any other brand with colorful bits.

## How much water does my hamster need?

You should provide fresh water for your hamster every
day. Hamsters tend to make a mess in a water bowl, so
it’s best to provide a water bottle instead.

## Can I give my hamster any treats?

An occasional treat is fine. Use those junk food items as
treats for your hamster. He or she will appreciate the
variety just like you do. In moderation, you can also give
your hamster sliced almonds, raw and unsalted pumpkin
or sunflower seeds or raw pistachios.

## What about fresh foods?

Since the nutrition is unprocessed, living fresh food is
essential to hamsters’ health and provides excitement
apart from the same boring lab block.

## What type of cage do I need for my hamster?

The minimum size habitat a hamster should have is
18x24 inches. A 20 gallon aquarium with a tight fitting
screen lid or a plastic tub with a well ventilated lid are the
best choices. A 10 gallon tank is not big enough for any
hamster. Wire cages are only safe if the bars are close
together and the cage is not too tall. Hamsters have
terrible eyesight and can easily fall from heights. They can
also break their legs if their feet get caught in the bars of
the cage. Crittertrails, Habitrails and SAM habitats are
strongly discouraged as they tend to be too small and
cramped. Cages with tubes are hard to keep clean and
have poor ventilation, which means a higher risk of
sickness and disease.

## Should I put wood chews in my hamster’s habitat?

Yes. Wood chews are vitally important to a hamster’s
health as hamsters’ teeth grow constantly. Wood chews
help hamsters grind their teeth down so they can eat
without pain.

## What kind of bedding should I buy?

Aspen, Carefresh and Kaytee Clean and Kozy all make
acceptable shavings for bedding. Carefresh can
sometimes harbor mites, so if you choose this brand, put
it in the freezer for 48 hours before placing in your
hamster’s habitat. Do not use pine, cedar chlorophyll,
sawdust or cat litter. These are all toxic to tiny animals like
hamsters, gerbils, mice and guinea pigs. They can cause
liver damage and respiratory illness and irritation.

## What about a hamster wheel?

Wild hamsters run 5 to 10 miles a night foraging for food,
so running is important. Just as barred walls are
dangerous, so is an open wheel made of metal rungs. A
solid plastic wheel provides the best running surface and
lets them straighten out as they run. For dwarf breeds,
choose a wheel that is a minimum 8 inches in diameter.
Syrian breeds need a wheel that is a minimum 12 inches
in diameter. Smaller diameter wheels cause hamsters’
backs to bend and can cause sore back or paralysis.

* Probiotics will help as well. You can find probiotics for pets at many pet stores and feed stores. They are cheaper in bulk, so shop around. For example, one oz of Fortiflora for cats is $32 at Petsmart. 8oz of probiotic powder appropriate for all species is $11 at Tractor Supply Co!
