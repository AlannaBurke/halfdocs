# Care and Keeping of Guinea Pigs

## What type of food should I feed my guinea pig?

Plain, quality pellets are best for guinea pigs. Guinea pigs under 6
months old should be fed an Alfalfa pellet and hay-based diet. Do not
feed your guinea pig any food with artificial coloring, seeds or corn as
these foods pose a choking hazard and cannot be properly digested.
Kleenmama hay and pellets are the best hay and pellets hat you can
provide for your guinea pig. Their shipping prices can be intimidating, but
it is more less expensive to order online than to buy in pet stores, even
with shipping. Kleenmama hay and pellets can be ordered online at
[www.kmshayloft.com](www.kmshayloft.com).

Oxbow Essentials is the second best in quality. Though it can be more
expensive than buying in bulk, it can be much more convenient to find
and purchase in stores. For store locations, visit

Sweet Meadow also provides quality hay and pellets. They can be
ordered in bulk and shipping is a bit more reasonable. It is important to
note that their winter hay isnâ€™t as good as their late spring and summer
hay. To order, visit [www.sweetmeadowfarm.com](www.sweetmeadowfarm.com).

Small Pet Select provides quality hay and pellets as well.
To order, visit [www.smallpetselect.com](www.smallpetselect.com).

## What about fresh foods?

Guinea pigs should be given fresh vegetables on a daily basis. Fresh fruits
are also safe, but should only be given as a treat, not as a primary source
of nutrition. Many grocery stores are willing to set aside some of their daily
veggie scraps if you call and request them in advance. Guinea pig pigs
who eat a regular diet of veggies and fruits do not need vitamin C
supplemented unless your cavy savvy veterinarian recommends it for a
specific health issue. For a full list of fresh foods and their nutritional
values for guinea pigs, visit [www.guinealynx.info/chart.html](www.guinealynx.info/chart.html).

## Can I give my guinea pig treats?
An occasional treat is fine, but remember that anything
with artificial colors, seeds or corn are not healthy or safe
for your guinea pig. Oxbow Essentials Small Animal
Treats are some of the best treats you can purchase for
your guinea pig. You can also give your guinea pig a
piece of fresh fruit as a treat.
