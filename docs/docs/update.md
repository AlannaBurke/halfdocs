This guide is a living document, and we encourage you to submit updates or additions!

It is hosted by GitHub, so if you're familiar with contributing to Git repositories and submitting pull requests, you can check out the code here: https://github.com/AlannaBurke/halfdocs

If you're not familiar with Git, navigate here: https://github.com/AlannaBurke/halfdocs/tree/master/docs/docs

You should see all of the pages listed - some are nested in folders. Find the page you want to edit, and click on it:

Then you'll see a menu on the right-hand side, with an "edit" button - click that. 

Now you'll see the page open for editing. We use Markdown to style the pages - it's a pretty straightforward syntax to understand, and you can learn more here: [https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

One of the most important things to know is that you need two spaces after a line for a line break.  

Once you're done with your edits, scroll down, and you'll see some fields to fill out. Give a brief description of your changes and click "Propose changes."

This will open up the Pull Request form, which is how we allow people to submit changes to the site. Click "Create Pull Request." This will send your edit to us to review!
