# Adopting a small animal

Before adopting an animal, please do thorough research on their care. Small animals are often advertised as good "beginner" pets, but many of them require specialized care that is more complex than that of cats and dogs. You must also consider the lifespan of the animal, and considerations like "who will take care of my rabbit when I go to college?"

Once you've decided on the kind of animal you'd like to adopt and you've learned about their care, you can check out our adoptable animals on petfinder"
