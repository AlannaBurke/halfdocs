#### Fees
### Surgery Fees - Sterilization
||Spay (Female)|	Neuter (Male)|
|----|----|---|
|Cats|		$94|	$89|
|Dogs		|$180 (<25 lbs.)|	$178 (<25 lbs.)|
||$198 (26 - 50 lbs.)|	$198 (26 - 50 lbs.)|
||$216 (51 - 80 lbs.)|	$216 (51 - 80 lbs.)|
||$234 (81 - 100 lbs.)|	$234 (81 - 100 lbs.)|

Dogs over 100 lbs. will require an office evaluation prior to spaying or neutering.

* It is preferable that dogs "in heat" (estrus) not be operated upon until the cycle has ended due to the possibility of additional surgical time and materials. This is usually 8 weeks after genital swelling has subsided. Female dogs and cats in heat can be safely spayed during their cycle without additional surgical risk. 

* Umbilical (belly button) hernias, retained puppy teeth, and rear dewclaws should be removed at the time of your pets’ sterilization procedure. Fees for these procedures are also discounted and can be discussed when your appointment is made.
