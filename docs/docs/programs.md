##### Henry's Cupboard

At the Brandywine Valley SPCA, we understand that sometimes pets are surrendered into shelters not because of the lack of a loving home, but because that home has fallen under hardship. To help ease this circumstance, we offer Safety Net programs to lessen the number of pets unnecessarily surrendered to our shelter.

The Brandywine Valley SPCA has teamed up with CHILD, Inc. and People’s Place, two Delaware domestic violence shelters, to provide victims of abuse free housing and care for their pets, as they transition to safety.
