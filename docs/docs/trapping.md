# Why TNR?

* [Even wildlife conservationists agree: Study proves TNR is the way to go](https://bestfriends.org/blogs/2019/08/14/even-wildlife-conservationists-agree-study-proves-tnr-way-go)

* When feral cats are trapped, neutered and returned to their territory, they no longer reproduce.
* Stopping sexual activity eliminates the noise associated with mating behavior and dramatically reduces fighting and the noise it causes.
* Neutered feral cats also roam much less and become less visible and less prone to injury from cars.
* Foul odors are greatly reduced as well because neutered male cats no longer spray or produce pungent urine.
* When the colony is then monitored by a caretaker who removes and/or TNRs any newly arrived cats, the population stabilizes and gradually declines over time.
* Female cats are healthier because they are no longer mating and giving birth.

# About Feral Cats
 * [Do Feral Cats Live Miserable Lives?](https://www.worldanimalfoundation.com/advocate/companion-animals/params/post/1281055/do-feral-cats-live-miserable-lives)

 > According to a study conducted by Dr. Julie Levy at the University of Central Florida, the majority of cats (83 percent) in the 11 cat colonies studied were present on the campus for more than six years. It’s quite likely that many of the observed cats far exceeded that life span, since approximately one-half of the free-roaming cats first observed in the study were already adults, so their true ages were unknown. Furthermore, according to Dr. Levy, the body weights of these free-roaming cats, when compared with pet cats in previous studies, exhibited “no significant differences.” Neutering these cats resulted in an increase in body weight and healthy overall body condition.

> Other studies reported similar findings. For instance, from 1993 to 2004, seven TNR organizations throughout the nation collected data on 103,643 free-roaming cats examined in spay/neuter clinics. Less than 1 percent of these animals needed to be euthanized because of debilitating conditions, trauma or infectious diseases. The one program that tested for FeLV and FIV reported an overall infection rate of 5.2 percent, which is similar to previous studies that reported results for both pet and feral cats.

# How to Trap
* [The 7 Steps of TNR](https://www.neighborhoodcats.org/how-to-tnr/getting-started/the-7-steps-of-tnr)  
* [TNR Handbook from Neighborhood Cats](files/nc_tnr_handbook_web_v5-4.pdf)    

* Withhold food for a couple of days - just a couple, nothing extreme. The cats need to be just hungry enough to ignore the instincts telling them not to go into the trap.
* Don’t put the trap out in the open. Try to put it next to a building, under a bush - make it blend in as best you can. 
* Make sure the trap is level and flat on the ground. You don’t want it to move when the cat steps into it. 
* Cover the trap. You can make trap covers, but a sheet or towel will do. 
* Use the best, smelliest food you can. Tuna, sardines, and KFC extra crispy (really!) are used by professional trappers.


## Drop Trapping
* If you have a cat who will not go into a trap, consider using a drop trap.

[Humane Deterrents](https://www.alleycat.org/community-cat-care/humane-deterrents/?fbclid=IwAR3oZ09f7I1T6QQtbgUiUQr8KcnfKPsczm2Y9P6c4Ip_BY9N1blJMo8KrHk)

* Scarecrow: A motion-activated sprinkler, an infrared sensor responds to motion and releases a three-second blast of water. The sprinkler, which “fires” 1,000 times on only one 9-volt battery, covers an area approximately 45 feet wide by 35 feet long. Search online or call Contech, the manufacturer, for the nearest retailer: 1-800-767-8658.
* CatStop: This deterrent uses a motion sensor and emits a high-pitched, ultrasonic alarm that can’t be heard by humans but will frighten most cats. You place the unit facing the area you want to protect and it covers about 300 sq.feet. It requires a 9-volt battery, and can operate up to nine months with one battery. CatStop is a good choice for areas where children play. Search online or call Contech, for the nearest retailer: 1-800-767-8658.
* Cat Scat: This non-chemical cat and wildlife repellent consists of plastic mats that are pressed into the soil. Each mat has flexible plastic spikes that are harmless but effective. You can purchase this product at [www.gardeners.com](www.gardeners.com).
* Shake-Away: This nontoxic granular deterrent contains the scent of fox, bobcat and coyote, animals that prey on cats. A 20-ounce bottle will cover 600 linear feet. One drawback is that it must be re-applied to remain effective. For more information, visit [www.critter-repellent.com](www.critter-repellent.com).
* Concrete pavers, river rocks, large pinecones, chicken wire (sharp edges down) or large bark can cover loose soil, discouraging cats from eliminating there.
* Plant the herb rue or coleus canina (scaredy-cat coleus), decorative plants that repel cats.
* Generously sprinkle cayenne pepper, coffee grounds, pipe tobacco, lemongrass oil, citronella oil, eucalyptus oil, or mustard oil on the ground to deter cats.

To reduce the incidence of cats eliminating on neighbors’ properties, caregivers need to either
contain the cats or provide them with an appropriate place to do their business. Sometimes cat
fencing can be used to keep the cats confined to a caregiver’s property, but isn’t always possible.
In this case, caregivers should provide the cats with litter boxes and scoop them regularly. To
make a large litter-box area, use plastic concrete mixers or a child’s sandbox.

One useful product for odor control is NaturVet Yard Odor Eliminator, available online at
www.naturvet.com or by calling 1-888-628-8783. It’s a nontoxic odor eliminator safe for use on
grass, plants, patios, concrete, fences, or any other surface where pet odors are a problem.
