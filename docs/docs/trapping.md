* Don’t put the trap out in the open. Try to put it next to a building, under a bush - make it blend in as best you can. 
* Make sure the trap is level and flat on the ground. You don’t want it to move when the animal steps into it. 
* Cover the trap. You can make trap covers, but a sheet or towel will do. 
* Use the most enticing food you can. For small animals, think cut bell peppers, cilantro, cucumber.


## Drop Trapping
* If you have an animal who will not go into a trap, consider using a drop trap.
