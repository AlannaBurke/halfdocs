## I FOUND AN ANIMAL: WHAT DO I DO?
* Assess the cat’s condition. Is it in immediate danger? If it’s injured, sick, starving, dehydrated, or otherwise unlikely to survive outside, catch the cat. Do whatever you can do to get it off the street immediately. If you have to put it in your basement, garage, porch, whatever, it’s better than where it was, and you can improve its situation drastically.
* Take the weather into account. Frail cats will be at a higher risk in very cold or very hot temperatures.
* If the cat is friendly, your work will be easier.
* If the cat is feral, you’ll need to trap it. 
* Check all cats for an ear tip - this will tell you if they’ve already been TNR’d. 
* If the cat appears pregnant, make a clinic appointment immediately. Pregnant cats need to be spayed. Also, pyometra is a uterine infection which can kill cats if left untreated and can make cats look pregnant. If the cat looks at all possibly pregnant, prioritize their spay.

* Helpful tip - put a box with some soiled litter from your cat’s litter box outside. If your cat is having trouble finding its way home, it will be able to smell this from a long distance. Keep an eye on it to make sure you’re not attracting any unwanted guests.
